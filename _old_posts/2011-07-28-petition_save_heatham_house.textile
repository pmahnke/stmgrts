An "online petition to save Heatham House":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/council_government_and_democracy/petitions/online_petitions/epetitions.htm?mgl=mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx&ID=42&RPID=7637922&HPID=7637922 has been started and runs until 4<sup>th</sup> October 2011 and has been created because;

bq. "The Twickenham Area Action plan proposes that Heatham House and its grounds could be sold for residential or hotel use and the youth centre moved into new premises on the old royal mail sorting office site next door."

The "Friends of Heatham House":http://www.friendsofheathamhouse.org.uk are trying to prevent the Council moving the youth facility from Heatham House and are seeking 1,000 signatures to force a full council debate on the subject.

However, Council says;

bq.  "There is no Council plan to remove a youth facility in Twickenham. There has been no Council decision to close Heatham House.
bq. 
bq. This Council will retain permanently a key youth facility in central Twickenham that has access to a significant green area. Any suggestion otherwise is totally without foundation."
bq. 
p. Why not have your say?
