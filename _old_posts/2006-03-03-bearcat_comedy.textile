From James Punnett of the "Bearcat Comedy Club":https://stmargarets.london/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200509210632&action=getlisting;

bq.. "On Tuesday we had a very apologetic phone call from Al to say he has been
called to Los Angeles to do TV chat shows this weekend ahead of his new
sitcom on Fox TV in the US.

Our Saturday show goes ahead of course with MILTON JONES now added Your
tickets are still reserved, and I will assume you are still coming unless I
hear from you.

Al was keen to say sorry, and that he will try to come down to see us when
he can, later in the year."
