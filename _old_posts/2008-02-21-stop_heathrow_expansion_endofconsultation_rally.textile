At the Central Hall, Westminster on 25th February 2008, 7pm.

It is a great chance to show the breadth of opposition there is to the expansion proposals. Bring yourself! No charge! Bring your friends!

Be part of the thousands of voices saying ‘No’!

A wide range of speakers! Live Music! Campaign videos!

The Lobby of Parliament will run from 5pm until 10pm.

It is an opportunity for anybody who wishes to go and lobby their MP in Parliament. It is better to let you MP know beforehand that you are coming, but it is not essential that you do. All you need to do is: go to the St Stephens Entrance of the House of Commons (that’s the main entrance); tell the police you are part of the Heathrow lobby (the lobby has been agreed with the police) go to the Central Lobby and ask to see your MP.  Even if your MP is onside, it is worth going to lobby them because part of the purpose of the exercise is to show other MPs just how much concern there is about the issue.
