    bq. "The new "Guide to Richmond Park":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/archives/2011/03/the_friends_publish_the_first_guide_book_to_richmo.html we've just published is selling like hot cakes with re-orders from practically all the bookshops in the area we've supplied to.  A great thing for bookshops is that the Guide is NOT available on Amazon  so they're doing very well with sales.  It would be good if you can to give a mention to "Langton's":http://www.langtonsbookshop.com/, the indie bookshop, in (Church Street) Twickenham to say the Guide is available.
