The three ward councillors have combined with the ward's Safer Neighbourhood police team to hold regular "Drop in Surgeries" at Eurowash Launderette, 99 Whitton Rd, on the last Thursday of each month, between 2 pm and 3 pm. Residents are invited to drop in to discuss crime fighting, security and any Council issues.
