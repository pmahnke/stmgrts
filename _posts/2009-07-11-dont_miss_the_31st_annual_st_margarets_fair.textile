_This year the Fair will be on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> July starting at 12.00_

<a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/smf_map09.pdf">Here is a map of the fairground (pdf).</a>

<p>There will be a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/schedule.html">full programme</a> of  entertainment throughout the day, starting with a popular children's  '5-a-side' <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/football.html">football</a> tournament in the  morning on Moormead.

During the afternoon there is a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/dogshow.html">dog show</a>  on little Moormead across Hillview Road.

The <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/music.html">musical</a> entertainment will run all  afternoon on the stage, and we're moving the stage further  away from the tea tent to help separate the 'rock' from the rolls.

There will be announcements, interviews and music throughout the  day from <a href="http://www.radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk/">Radio West  Middlesex</a>.

The fair organisers run the Tea Tent,  Beer Tent, Pimms  Stall, Greek Food, the BBQ,  the Bric-a-brac stall, a Plant  stall, the Silent Auction, and the  Coconut Shy.

All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please  support these stalls. Look on our plan of the <a href="//stmgrts.org.uk/assets/images/2009/smf_map09.pdf" target="_blank">fair  ground</a> to find where they are. See how we spend the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/charities.html">money</a>.



Every year volunteers organise and staff the following:

* The BBQ is run by parents from <a href="http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/richmond/schools/ois/">Orleans  Infant School's PTA &#8211; FOOI</a>.
* Local parents organise a Pimms stall from <a href="http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/richmond/schools/op/">Orleans  Park School.</a>
* Site stewarding is done by the parents of children at <a href="http://www.st-stephens.richmond.sch.uk/index.html">St Stephens Junior School</a>, and an early morning team is on site  from 7am to help stall holders.
* The fair site is kept clean by parents at <a href="http://www.st-marys.richmond.sch.uk/">St  Mary&#8217;s CE School</a> who clean up throughout the day and on  the Sunday morning.
