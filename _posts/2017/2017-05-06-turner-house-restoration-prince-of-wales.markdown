*The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation is supporting the restoration of Sandycombe Lodge, JMW Turner's country villa in Twickenham.*

The award, from the Foundation's Small Grants Programme, is a contribution towards the cost of the garden landscaping and planting, as part of Turner's House Trust's 'Returning Turner to Twickenham' project.

The garden is key to the setting and character of Sandycombe Lodge. Planning its future appearance is an important part of the development of the total restoration project. Clearly there is no realistic possibility of restoring the rural surroundings, or the impression Turner's once-large grounds would have created in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  The aim is to portray a 'flavour' of the garden that Turner and his father might have enjoyed."

> "The garden project is being led by a team experienced in historic garden restoration and includes reinstatement of some of the features clearly seen in William Havell's coloured drawing circa 1814," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, Chairman, Turner's House Trust.

> "The funding support of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation is helping us to create a garden that reflects Turner's enjoyment of this peaceful rural retreat from the London art world, and which creates a space that visitors can enjoy."


Turner's House Trust seeks further support towards the final planting phase of the garden. Donations can be made via the website [www.turnerintwickenham.org.uk](http://www.turnerintwickenham.org.uk)
