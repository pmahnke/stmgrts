On 13<sup>th</sup> October a new consultation starts to help determine the future of the next Community Plan for 2007-2017. *Your Say 2017* is a campaign being launched by the Local Strategic Partnership , a group of organisations whose aim is to work together to improve services within the borough, including the Police and the health services.

The consultation will take the form of a website through which residents and local people can record their views on key priorities. People can go [online](http://www.yoursay2017.org.uk/) and register from the 19<sup>th</sup> September and then it will go live from the 13<sup>th</sup> October to 3<sup>rd</sup> November 2006.

There will be a number of themes that run through the consultation:

-   Safer and Stronger
-   Greener and Cleaner
-   Healthier Communities
-   Children and Young People
-   Vibrant and Prosperous

As well as using the website, the council and it’s partners will be arranging an active week of consultation from 16th to 20th October, when we will be visiting venues around the borough to gather people’s views directly.
