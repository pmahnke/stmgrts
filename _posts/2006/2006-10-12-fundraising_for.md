St Margarets Resident Jon Mason is planning on trekking to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and raising money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association in the process.

bq.. "Kilimanjaro has been on my 'must do' list ever since a work trip to Kenya enabled me to view from a distance this hugely impressive Mountain. Standing at 5895m it is the highest peak in Africa and the tallest freestanding mountain in the world. Thankfully it can be conquered by walking rather than climbing, the dangers coming from altitude sickness and exposure. Statistics are varied and unreliable but less than half of the people who make the attempt actually reach the summit, and even in good conditions the effects of altitude can prevent even the fittest climber from continuing. We have chosen the Lemosho Route, one of the least used of the 7 possible paths, which involves camping for 6 nights on the mountain and should give us plenty of time to acclimatise successfully.

Climbing Kilimanjaro is something that one thinks long and hard about, and in that thought process it becomes obvious that there must be a significant reason for doing it. For me is partly about the challenge, and partly about the opportunity that this creates for helping others and giving something back. For that reason I would really appreciate it if you could help me raise some money for an important charity."
