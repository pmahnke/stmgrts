The Online Communities (OnComm), the group behind many Richmond Borough sites (e.g. "twickenham-online.co.uk":http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100114165808/http://oncomarchive.com/newsdev/news/archive.php?sheet_name=Twickenham, "richmond-online.co.uk":http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100114165812/http://oncomarchive.com/newsdev/news/archive.php?sheet_name=Richmond,  "Mogden Sewage Treatment Community Site":http://www.mogden.org.uk/, etc...) has "announced":http://www.say-it-all.com/newsdev/admin/story.php?intro_id=2034 that it is closing down after Christmas.

Oncom has been been supporting grassroots e-democracy for ten years, but has never been able to secure government funding.  They have built up a huge readership and given a voice to the people on many divisive issues.  The VoxPop forums have been a particularly powerful tool to talk directly with Councillors.

With all the talk about e-democracy, it is a shame that Oncom could not find the funding they require to keep going.  The Oncom sites played an important part of our community and the platform they provided will be sadly missed.
