"I wouldn't even say the church was a joke. In our area it's an irrelevance,” says the spiritually exhausted Rev. Lionel Espy to his Bishop early in [Racing Demon](https://stmargarets.london/event/Play/200609290404).

When David Hare’s play was first staged by the National Theatre in 1990, to much critical acclaim, the Sunday Times wrote: “In conflict with government, torn with internal dissentions on matters of doctrine and practice, the Church of England finds itself enjoying unwelcome publicity…”

Racing Demon is as relevant today as it was in Mrs Thatcher’s era, and Twickenham audiences are fortunate to have the opportunity to enjoy this compelling play on the stage of the Mary Wallace Theatre.

Racing Demon runs for a week from Saturday October 21st to Saturday October 28th. Performances start at 7.45, except for Sundays when the play starts at 4.00pm. There will an additional matinee at 3.00pm on Saturday October 28th, and no show on Wednesday October 25th.

Tickets are priced at £7 for the first three nights, £8 after that. Seats can be booked by phone on 020 8744 0547. Credit card bookings are also now accepted (Mastercard and Visa only).
