After a long five months, Richmond Council Planning Officer, Polly Perks has recommended that the Planning Committee give its ‘permission’ for the proposed [Sunday Fine Foods Market](/archives/2005/08/sunday_fine_foo.html) in the St Margarets Tavern parking lot. The Richmond Planning Committee will meet on the 16<sup>th</sup> March 2006 at 6:30 pm in the Salon at [York House](/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?key=200508171541&action=getlisting) to decide whether to grant or reject this recommendation.

The Planning Officer felt;

> "the change of use of this car park to allow a food market on a Sunday morning is considered to be acceptable and will not result in a negative impact on the Building of Townscape Merit or the character and setting of the Crown Road Conservation area. This proposal is not considered to result in an overbearing impact on, or excessive loss of light or privacy to, neighbouring properties."

The only constraint was that the market limited its hours from 10am to 2:30pm, shorter than the originally requested 4pm, with 30 minutes to setup and close-down.
