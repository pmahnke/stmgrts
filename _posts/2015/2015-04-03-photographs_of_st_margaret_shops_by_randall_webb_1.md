Howard Webb has passed along a few photos of local shops from his late father, Randall Webb.

> "For more than 30 years Randall taught photography, in Richmond and Twickenham for Richmond Adult Education, and at colleges and schools including St Martin's School of Art, London, the German School, Richmond, and the American School, in Thorpe, Surrey. He worked with photographic groups including Framework, the Richmond and Twickenham Photographic Society..."

All the photos were taken in 1976 and give an interesting look back into our not so distant past.
