*Players needed for competitive (but friendly) weekly 7-a-side football*

I organise a group of local players that get together every Wednesday evening at 9pm for a game of 7-a-side, and we need a few extra players to keep the numbers up.

If you are interested in playing - it's a reasonable standard and competitive but always friendly and good natured - then drop me a note at richard.jackson100 (at) gmail.com.

We currently play at Goals at Gillette Corner and the cost is £8/session.

There are also occasional beers afterwards from time to time!
