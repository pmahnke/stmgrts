Corks will be popping at one of South London’s fastest growing independent wine merchants when <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/wine_aNd_spirits/200511281416">The Good Wine Shop</a>  in St Margarets hosts a special "Winter wine tasting event":http://stmgrts.org.uk/event/meeting/200705141724.  

A selection of up to 40 wines will be on offer for guests to sample during the event which takes place at Winchester Hall (side of The Turks Head public house) in St Margarets on Saturday 10th November, 1.00pm to 4.00pm. 

Owner Mark Wrigglesworth will be on hand to help guests decipher their Rioja from their Riesling and offer expert tips and advice on choosing the best wines for all occasions. Guests will also be able to enjoy a range of breads and cheeses to compliment the wines, supplied by new local cheese shop Yellowwedge.


Mark said: “We believe wine is all about enjoyment. There can be a certain snobbery surrounding wines but at The Good Wine Shop we aim to break down those barriers, offering the finest vintages from the world’s best small producers, which wouldn’t normally be found on the high street.”

The Good Wine Shop was established six years ago and since Mark took over in 2004, the emphasis has been as much on personal service as on selling excellent wines.

“We are looking to offer quality, original wines that are value for money. But individual tastes differ vastly and a wine that is enjoyed by one person may not be to the taste of another. By getting to know our customers personally we can actively seek out wines to suit their particular palate.” added Mark.

Tickets can be purchased from The Good Wine Shop(020 8892 7756) in advance at a cost of &pound;10.00 per person and a refund of the ticket price is available to those purchasing a case(12 bottles) on the day.
