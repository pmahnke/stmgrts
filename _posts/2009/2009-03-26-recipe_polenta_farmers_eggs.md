### Polenta Farmer's Eggs (Huevos Rancheros)

|                     |                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 3/4 cup (125 grams) | polenta                  |
| 1.5 cups (375 ml)   | water                    |
| 1/4 tsp             | salt                     |
| 1/4 tsp             | cumin seeds              |
| 1/4 tsp             | coriander seeds          |
| 1 tsp               | olive oil                |
| 1                   | green pepper diced       |
| 1                   | onion diced              |
| 1 can               | diced tomatoes (drained) |
| 6                   | eggs                     |

#### Instructions

1.  Combine the polenta, salt and water in a pot and bring to a rolling boil. As soon as it boils, turn the heat off and let the polenta cool slightly and absorb all the water.
2.  Spread the polenta on the bottom of a greased 9x12 baking tray.
3.  Crush the coriander and cumin seeds in either a blender or a mortar and pestle (you can substitute powdered spices but the flavor will be milder)
4.  Saute the onions and peppers in the olive oil for about 5 minutes.
5.  Add the spices and drained tomatoes and cook another 2-3 minutes.
6.  Spoon the mixture on top of the polenta. Using a spoon make 6 indents in the vegetables where the eggs will go.
7.  Crack the eggs into the indentations.
8.  Cover the dish and cook at 180 degrees until the eggs have set. Approximately 20-25 minutes.

*This recipe can be partially made the night before. Simply put the dish in the refrigerator after step 6 and finish in the morning.*
