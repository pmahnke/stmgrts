"Nearly four years ago I wrote a post on comments, spam and a recommended etiquette for this site":https://stmargarets.london/archives/2005/12/on_comments.html that I still believe is the right balance for creating an open forum with some accountability.  Admittedly, this is a difficult balance between encouraging people to speak freely and post easily and preventing unhelpful and unwanted remarks.  So I would like to reiterate the following:

* *Use your real name* where possible. If you cannot for whatever reason, use the same pseudonym consistently so it doesn’t appear that you are an angry mob.
* *Use you real email address* at all times _it isn't published_, but let's me know you are a real person.

Remember, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.
