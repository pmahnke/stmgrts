*Graffiti is a Criminal Offence, that not only looks bad, but can attract other crime to the area.*

If you are a victim of Graffiti then you should report it to your local "Safer Neighbourhood Police team":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/other/200606261156.

The Council will remove Graffiti from private premises free of charge, but however cannot remove graffiti from any private property without first having received the appropriate graffiti removal request form.

This form is accessed via Richmond Council’s Website
"www.richmond.gov.uk":http://www.richmond.gov.uk/ and going to the Environment and planning section, where you can download a Graffiti Removal Request Form (see "bit.ly/graffiti":http://bit.ly/graffiti ).
