Commuknity is a group of knitters and crocheters, beginners and old hands, who have decided to get together over a glass or two of wine for a knit and a natter. We meet in the St Margarets Pub on the first and third Mondays of the month.

Anybody is welcome, we’d love to see you there. For more info, email commuknity@hotmail.co.uk
