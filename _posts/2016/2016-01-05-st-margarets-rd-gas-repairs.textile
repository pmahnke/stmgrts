h4. National Grid to revamp vital gas mains in St Margarets, Twickenham

National Grid is delivering a vital gas mains revamp in St Margarets, Twickenham, which will help ensure the local community remains safely connected to reliable gas supplies.

Work will begin on Monday 18 January 2016 and is expected to last for eight weeks. It involves replacing ageing iron gas mains in St Margarets Road with tough new long lasting pipes which will last for decades.

The work will be carried out in two stages and will take place on the southbound carriageway and footpath.  The first stage will take place between The Barons and the roundabout at the A316. Once completed, work will continue at the opposite side of the roundabout up to the junction with Netherton Road.

To enable this essential work to be carried out safely and efficiently, a two-way traffic light system will be implemented and the use of bus stops in the road will be suspended. Two bus stops will be suspended during the first stage of the work and another two stops suspended during the second. Parking in St Margarets Road will also be suspended.

Gas engineers will require access to some properties to replace service pipes. This work will involve a brief interruption of the gas supply. Affected properties will be notified. All National Grid engineers carry official identity cards, which people should ask to see before allowing them on their property.

Phil Walden, Authorising Engineer at National Grid, said: “This is a major project but we’re doing all we can to deliver it with as little disruption as possible.

“Wherever possible we’re using innovative technology to insert the new pipe into the old main, which is much quicker than digging up the road to lay new pipe.”

He added: “During peak travel times we will manually control the traffic lights to reduce congestion and we’ll also work at weekends when necessary to ensure we finish the job on time.”

All our employees carry official identity cards, which people should ask to see before letting them on their property.

For further information on this project call 0800 096 5678.
