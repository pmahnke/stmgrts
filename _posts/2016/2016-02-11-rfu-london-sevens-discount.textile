The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is offering local residents exclusive access to discounted tickets for this year's HSBC London Sevens, as part of its ongoing commitment to the local community.

The grand finale of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series takes place on Saturday 21 and Sunday 22 May 2016, with this year's event recreated as a Feast of Rugby, which will celebrate the food and rugby of competing nations, in response to feedback from the local community.

Ian Ritchie, RFU Chief Executive, said: "We are glad to be offering the local community the chance to enjoy the HSBC London Sevens. Local residents and school groups can look forward to an action-packed weekend in a friendly atmosphere, with a focus on fantastic food and running rugby, as the teams prepare for Rio 2016."

The RFU's offer to local residents includes a 75% discount on adult tickets, priced at &pound;10, while juniors will pay just &pound;5. Local schools will also benefit, with 100 free tickets for each of the 22 schools in the Kick Start programme, the RFU's schools partnership.

At the launch of the community offer with students from Twickenham Academy, Orleans Park, St Mary's and Oaklands schools at Richmond Ice Rink in Strawberry Hill, also sponsored by the RFU, Orleans Park teacher Calum Briggs said, "I can't wait for this year's HSBC London Sevens. Twickenham Stadium is stitched into the fabric of our community and we are able to show our students what a great experience the weekend is. What a fantastic opportunity to watch the best teams in the world battle it out in one of the rugby calendar's biggest events."

Tickets for local residents are available to purchase from the RFU's website at englandrugby.com/TwickenhamCommunity.
