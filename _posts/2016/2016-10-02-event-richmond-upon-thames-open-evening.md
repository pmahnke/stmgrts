Parents and school pupils currently in year six are invited to an open evening to find out more about the new secondary school in Twickenham.

The Richmond upon Thames School (RTS) will open on the Richmond upon Thames College site, Egerton Road in September 2017 to 150 Year 7 pupils. It is part of the wider Education and Enterprise Campus.

A Free School Trust has been established to run the secondary school, with a membership that includes; Harlequin Football Club, Haymarket Media Group, Waldegrave School, Richmond upon Thames College, Richmond Council and Achieving for Children. All will offer opportunities to students at the school.

On Monday 3 October from 6.30 to 8.30pm, parents and prospective pupils have the opportunity to find out more about the school at an Open Evening at The Stoop Rugby Ground. For those unable to attend, the school’s Headteacher is hosting another weekend, Open Day on Saturday, 15th October, 11.30am - 1.30pm.

At the event there will be an exhibition showcasing information about the ongoing school building project, the future curriculum plans for the school and extra-curricular activities. There will also be an opportunity to have a sneak preview of the uniform that has been designed following consultation with parents.

Kelly Dooley, the Headteacher of the School, will also be giving presentations.

Mrs Dooley said:

> "Choosing a new secondary school can sometimes be a challenging experience - particularly for those considering our school - which isn't open yet.
> 
>  "Our Open Evening will give parents and potential students, the opportunity to learn more about the school and to meet the staff, trustees and other parents involved in creating and shaping its future.
> 
>  "RTS will provide an inspiring place for young people to learn and work purposefully towards achieving their best at all times. Our students will be valued as individuals, recognised for their talents and challenged in their endeavours.
> 
> "I hope that many families will come to the Open Evening, to find out more and join us on this exciting journey."
