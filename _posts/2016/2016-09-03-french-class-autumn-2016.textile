Bonjour! Is anyone here keen to join French conversation classes? Since having twins last November I have restricted language teaching to friendly, supportive adult groups, with maximum six members. From September we will have a couple of spaces in intermediate and advanced French levels and I'd love another friendly local to join us.

Every week we choose a different topic to discuss in French. People find it a great chance to catch up on each other's news, as well become more confident and fluent speaking French.

Any questions, please email me ("infolivelanguages@gmail.com":mailto:infolivelanguages@gmail.com), or call me: 07855 528 483, or for more info see: "www.live-languages.com":http://www.live-languages.com/
