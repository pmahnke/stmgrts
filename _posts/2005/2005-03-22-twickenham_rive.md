After years of doing nothing, the Richmond Council has finally agreed to some *"short-term scheme"* improvements to the Twickenham Riverside. They have approved tearing down the derelict pool building and replacing with a café, toilets and playground.

The project is well under way with the demolition complete and the construction under way.
