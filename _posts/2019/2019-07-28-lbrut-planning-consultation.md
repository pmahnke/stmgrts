Residents are being invited to have their say on how Richmond Council intends to engage with our communities when carrying out consultations on planning policy documents and planning applications.

The Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) is a statutory document which sets out how the Council will engage with the community and other stakeholders around planning policies and planning applications.

Richmond Council's SCI was first adopted in 2006 and has so far been amended twice - in 2009 and 2015. The latest draft takes account of recent legislation changes to reflect modern plan making processes.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of Richmond Council's Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee said:

> The latest draft SCI, which will inform our approach to consultations, is being revised to bring it in line with updated national planning legislation and with the Local Plan and other supplementary planning guidance.

> It reflects our commitment to involve our local residents in a meaningful way on developments which will impact their local communities. If you would like to have your say on the draft SCI I encourage you to do so before the deadline."

Have your say by visiting [haveyoursay.citizenspace.com](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/richmondecs/consultation-on-statement-of-community-involvement/consult_view/) before the 2<sup>nd</sup> September deadline.
