A free public information evening for EU citizens living in the borough will be held at The Exchange, 75 London Rd, Twickenham TW1 1BE on Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup> June from 6pm.

Attendees will be able to get updates on the latest Brexit developments and find out what steps they need to take to protect their future in the UK.

The event is delivered by Citizens Advice Richmond as part of a package of support, funded by the Council, aimed at enabling EU residents to get impartial, expert advice on nationality matters or the impact of the Government's proposals and options available for them.

Although the event is free you do [need to register to attend](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/information-event-for-eu-nationals-tickets-62145288230). You can also sign up for e-updates from Citizens Advice Richmond.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council said:

> "I know the EU citizens living in our borough may still have questions about the process and steps you need to take to secure your future in the United Kingdom and hopefully this info evening will answer some of those questions.

> "And remember, you have friends here in York House and as a Council we know the value you bring to our communities and we are determined to support you throughout the Brexit process."
