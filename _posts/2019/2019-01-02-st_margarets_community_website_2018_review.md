As 2018 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that has gone by, as we have in [2017](/archives/2017/12/st_margarets_community_website_2017_review.html), [2016](/archives/2016/12/st_margarets_community_website_2016_review.html), [2015](/archives/2015/12/st_margarets_community_website_2015_review.html) and [2014](/archives/2014/12/st_margarets_community_website_2014_review.html). The site has gone through many big changes this year, but not many people will notice, including:

- Adding a [data privacy page](https://stmargarets.london/privacy/) for GDPR
- Adding [open graph](http://ogp.me/), [schema.org](http://schema.org/Article), and twitter tags to make things look nicer when you share articles and events on social media
- Updated the CSS to the very good [Vanilla framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)  

### Articles and events

This year we wrote more articles, but published fewer events than in previous years.

#### Usage stats

These are up quite a bit from last year, mostly down to the very long tail of many of Martyn Day's articles:

|                   |    2018 |    2017 |    2016 |
| ----------------- | -------:| -------:| -------:|
| Sessions          | 110,629 |  63,915 |  63,903 |

### How people accessed the site

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets. This is why we continue making the site work better on smaller screens.  This year's mobile usage as soared to well over half of all sessions!

| Device  | Sessions | Change&nbsp;from&nbsp;2017 |
|:------- | --------:| --------------------------:|
| Desktop |    28.8% |                    -14.92% |
| Mobile  |   57.96% |                    +16.86% |
| Tablet  |   13.24% |                     -1.95% |
