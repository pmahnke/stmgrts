Environment Trust, a charity based in South West London, is encouraging local people to contribute to a more sustainable fashion industry by attending their first ever Clothes Swap event on 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2019 at the ETNA Centre in Twickenham.

Tickets for the event support the charity's vital conservation work and cost &pound;10 per person. People are asked to donate between 4 and 10 items of clothing and will be able to take home a new outfit of the same number of items. The event includes drinks, nibbles, fashion tips, raffle and more, all while being sustainable.

A global study in 2018 by removals company Movinga found that most people do not wear 50 per cent of the clothes in their wardrobes, with UK citizens being amongst the worst for having clothes they haven't worn for a year.

Sophie Norden, Fundraising and Partnership Manager at Environment Trust, says;

> "We are increasingly aware of the impact of the fashion industry on the environment. In fact, it is the second largest polluter in the world, after the oil industry, and the environmental damage is increasing as the industry grows.

> "However, there are solutions and alternatives to address these problems. The first step lies in building awareness and having the willingness to change. We hope to help people make this change with our first Clothes Swap and bring along clothes they no longer want."

Environment Trust encourages clothes donations to be dropped at the ETNA Centre, 13 Rosslyn Rd, St Margarets in Twickenham, TW1 2AR ahead of the event, kindly named if participating and, if possible, on hangers.

Clothes for all the ages and genders welcome, and donated clothes should be washed and in good condition. Clothes will also be accepted on the night and additional items welcome for a 'to purchase' rack.
