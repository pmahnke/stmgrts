Don't miss the "Great Annual Street Sale":https://stmargarets.london/archives/2008/08/great_annual_street_sale_september_6th_its_a_guara.html this Saturday from 2.00pm.

The array of things up for grabs at bargain basement prices is vast, from toys, books, CD’s and bric-a-brac at one end to home made cakes, jams, pickles, plants and Christmas cards at the other. Gardeners from the allotments will be selling fresh fruit and vegetables; the Church is running a Café and a Fair Trade stall. Even a team of neighbourhood police will be there marking bicycles. Last year GASS attracted nearly 60 stalls out onto the street which, according to one resident, were visible from aircraft flying into Heathrow!
