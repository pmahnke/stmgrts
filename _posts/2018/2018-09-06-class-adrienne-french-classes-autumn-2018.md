Calling local Francophiles looking to improve or perfect their French. I run friendly French conversation classes (only for adults during school hours I’m afraid) at intermediate and advanced levels.  

There are maximum 6 students per group. Due to popular demand I have built up from 1 to 5 regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all in increasingly confident French! N’oubliez pas la conversation générale en français et l’ambiance conviviale entre amis!

Please contact me ASAP if you’d like more info or to speak to a student. I have two spaces opening in Septembre: on Monday mornings and Tuesday lunchtimes… Premier venu, premier servi!
