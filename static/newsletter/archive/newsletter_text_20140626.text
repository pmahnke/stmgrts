﻿ROCK AROUND THE EMBARGO - PART 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    54 years ago, on 17th June 1960, the Shadows recorded "Apache", an
    instrumental that introduced to the UK a new and exciting sound
    played on a new and stylish American guitar - the Fender
    Stratocaster. Like many other British musicians the Shadows were
    fed up with the lack of decent guitars in the UK - so they decided
    to import one for themselves. Whenbq. "Apache" was released in July
    1960 it went straight to No. 1 and stayed there for 5 weeks.

LOCAL RESIDENTS OPPOSING PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF 'GLORIANA' DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    A public meeting has been called for Thursday, 3 July 2014 at
    6.30pm in Winchester Hall, Turks Head where an action group is
    getting together.

    By now many of you will have heard that the Council are looking
    to develop the site along the riverside to house the 'Gloriana'.
    They require an area that can put the boat into dry dock and
    of three proposed areas; we have now learnt the Council favour this
    area alongside the playground. Luckily we have heard about it
    before it has gone to a public consultation stage, so we have time
    to act and get a working group together to fight this proposal.

RICHMOND COULD BECOME HOME TO THE QUEEN'S ROYAL ROWBARGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The proposed new river park in Richmond upon Thames could become
    home to the Queen's Royal Row Barge, should planning permission
    be approved.

    Gloriana is the first Royal rowbarge to be built in over 200 years,
    built as a lasting legacy to mark Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee.

    Commissioned by Lord Sterling, she was built by a team led by local
    Master Boat Builder Mark Edwards MBE in 2012. She was the lead
    craft at the Diamond Jubilee Paegant which saw both Sir Steve
    Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent CBE take a lead role.

A316 ST MARGARETS BRIDGE CONSULTATION - A BRIDGE TOO FAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    On Wednesday 25 June at 3:30pm, local councillors will be joined
    by parents and residents at a street assembly against Transport
    for London's (TfL's) plans to decommission an existing footbridge
    over the A316 in St Margarets, Twickenham.

    Local Liberal Democrat Councillors, Alexander Ehmann, Ben Khosa and
    Geoff Acton (Councillors for St Margarets and North Twickenham
    Ward) have put their weight behind local residents and concerned
    parents, who have expressed dismay over TfL's recent proposal
    to dismantle the current footbridge crossing of the A316 at St
    Margarets roundabout and replace it with Toucan crossings.
