﻿NEW BUSINESSES BRING 50 NEW JOBS TO ST MARGARETS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    As the UK continues to be gripped by economic gloom, things are
    definitely looking up in St Margarets as the Deputy Mayor has
    opened 9 new and refurbished businesses all in one day.

    The businesses were formally opened by Deputy Mayor of Richmond,
    Cllr Lisa Blakemore, following The St Margarets Traders
    Association's close partnership with the Council to encourage new
    business to the area as well as to support existing traders. All
    of the retail units in St Margarets are now let and trading with 50
    new jobs created as a result.

    The Council contributed 4,000 from its Town Centre Opportunity
    Fund, boosting funds raised through the Traders Association. This
    mean that they were able to promote business in the area through a
    range of initiatives including the my St Margarets website and
    magazine which is delivered to 8000 homes and a further 4000 more
    being handed out around the borough. Other projects include the
    launch of the St Margarets shopping bag which aims to reduce the
    use of plastic bags. Over 2000 of the bags have been sold to date.
    The St Margarets heart logo project was also launched
    among businesses, which encouraged new customers to shops
    by promoting the catch phrase - where you have a choice, please
    shop with the heart. pounds

BOLD NEVISON - BACK FROM THE DEAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Did you ever hear told of that hero,
    Bold Nevison it was his name,
    And he rode about like a brave hero,
    And by that he gained a great fame,
    Now when I rode on the highway,
    I always had money in store.
    And whatever I took from the rich
    Why I freely gave it to the poor.
    I have never robbed no man of tuppence
    And I've never done murder nor killed.
    Though guilty I've been all my lifetime
    So gentlemen do as you please.

    THE BALLAD "Bold Nevison"


    We have heard tell of bold William Nevison before - and it was
    in these pages - a Robin Hood of the highway who 'never done murder
    nor killed'. Early one morning in 1676 at Gads Hill in Kent he
    robbed a sailor just home from sea. Realising that he had been
    recognised and fearing the rope that was surely waiting Nevison
    rode north on his mare Nutmeg to establish an alibi. At sunset
    of the same day, with 230 miles of bad road behind them Nevison and
    Nutmeg rode into York. After washing and changing his travel
    stained clothes and attending to the exhausted Nutmeg Nevison went
    out to find the Lord Mayor of York who was playing bowls. Engaging
    him in conversation Nevison made a bet with the Mayor on the
    outcome of his game - and made sure that the Mayor noted the time
    - 8.00pm.

LOCAL JAZZ QUARTET ON TOUR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The St Margarets based Julian Costello Quartet plays contemporary
    music that incorporates a range of different grooves, moods and
    colours, its textures both tuneful and melodic. Some of the tunes
    are really structured and scored while others are more free-flowing
    and left to chance. Playing tenor and soprano saxophones and
    composing all the music. Julian sees the group as his heritage
    to 'jam'; improvise and see what happens. The rest of the quartet
    feature very much as equals rather than as accompanists, and Julian
    tries to think of his solos as conversations with the rest of the
    group rather than traditional solos with rhythmic and harmonic
    accompaniment. To date the group has released a number
    of recordings, their most recent being Edge of Distinction and Cake
    and Consequences.

    "Costello is an extremely moody player on both saxophones and his
     compositions cover many musical areas...an emotive and soulful
     tenor player"
 
     - Jazzwise magazine
