EVENT REMINDER: RIVER THAMES DRAW-OFF WALK - 23 NOVEMBER 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Join us at our annual visit to see behind the scenes at Port
    of London Authority's Richmond Half Tide Lock, which maintains
    river levels through Richmond and Twickenham up to Teddington.

    At the Draw-off during the month of November, the Port of London
    Authority carries out maintenance on the Lock and the river reverts
    to its normal levels, exposing much of the river bed at low tide.

    The tour of the Lock, guided by the lock keeper, provides us with
    an insight into the history that led to its building and a close-up
    sight of its amazing Victorian mechanisms.

    We continue along the foreshore towards Richmond encountering the
    remarkable archaeology and ecology that is revealed at low-tide.

HOME FOR A CAT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    For our very pretty 10 year old female tabby cat.

    Maddy is a timid cat and would best suit an experienced cat owner.
    She would really prefer not to have to share her owners with other
    cats, dogs or young children. She would love a garden to sunbathe
    in. Maddy loves to have the company of her owners and be stroked
    and be made a fuss off. She is fully house trained and is very good
    in the house and has never done anything naughty in the home. Maddy
    has never been ill and is fighting fit. She has recently had all
    her inoculations and neutered.

    Maddy is only looking for a new home due to her owners
    personal situation.

    If you could give Maddy a home please call Kate - 07769974428

    Based in St Margarets
