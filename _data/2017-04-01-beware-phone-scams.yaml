    <p>I&#39;ve just had the same thing happen to me. Two calls one from John giving me a 6 figure number and asking the same questions, the second from a Micheal going over the questions and saying l&#39;ll receive another call tomorrow telling me how much l&#39;ll get, he also asked if l had l.d. as l would need this for the cheque and what l.d. l&#39;d be using. I thought this has to be a scam, and found your message. Thanks. I didn&#39;t catch the 1<sup>st</sup> number, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> was 01384410370.</p>

    <p>I have had exactly the same this week everyday for the last 4 days. On every call I have told them I&#39;m not interested and put the phone down but still they try again. They don&#39;t appear to take the rather unsubtle hint.</p>

    <p>These guys are still at it !!!! T They tried to get me to take out a new Life insurance company before they would send me a cheque and the government would only accept their company. Reported them to Action Fraud. Graham</p>

    <p>I have had the same calls for the last few weeks now telling me I&#39;m owed compensation from the Government regarding my PPI Claim and that and I&#39;m entitled to between &#194;&pound;3,500 - &#194;&pound;5,000  - they then go through all the usual scripted notes - the first/second time they rang I did half believe them as they had my name and previous address that I lived - the first phone call they went on to say that the only way I could have the full amount is if had some investment plan in place like life insurance, funeral plan, savings etc. which I said I hadn&#39;t - don&#39;t worry I will put you through to my colleague who can sort a life insurance policy for you and before the first payment is taken out cancel the policy - they then said please don&#39;t tell anyone about this which at the time I thought was a bit dodgy - when they went to transfer me to sort out taking a life insurance policy out i put the phone down - they must ring me from different mobile numbers once maybe twice a week - I received another call yesterday let him go through it all - then said to him I need to check this out as this might not be legitimate to which he gave me the following phone no. 0161 8261 725 (i haven&#39;t rang it) and confirmed he was from Claims Advisory Group and told me his name was Steve Roger bearing in mind please excuse me I&#39;m not being derogatory but he was Indian - reading all your comments I shall certainly be reporting this</p>
