    <p>Virol was great, my mother "doled it out" as a treat when my sister and I were "convalescing" from Whooping Cough or Mumps (no MMR in those days). Don&#39;t remember being given at school though. But Martyn is right that no-one seemed to have allergies. Except I do recall one - just one.  At the Christmas school party, about 1960, the teacher suddenly remembered we had a boy with Diabetes in the class and announced to the entire room (50 children + helping adults) that he couldn&#39;t have the usual cake, jelly &amp; ice-cream etc.  His solution for this mortified 9 year old?  "Find him some fruit!" Maybe we were healthier then (no multi-billion food &amp; drink industry advertising on colour telly) but teachers are now certainly better informed and more sensitive.</p>

    <p>I remember Virol especially as my parents had a pharmacy.  We didn&#39;t get it at school although we did get 1/3 pint of milk, which was never in the fridge so it was warm in the summer (eugh!) and frozen in winter (more eugh!).  Interesting history above because Beecham (who produced Horlicks) purchased Bovril, Marmite &amp; Ambrosia from Cavenham Foods.  The company was sold on again to CPC in 1990. My parents used to give us Minadex if we were recovering from colds, cough, tonsilitis etc. and Lucozade with that beautifully  orange cellophaned wrapped bottle.  Rosehip syrup was also popular in the 60s - another very sweet syrup which was good for us and we believed them - a spoonful of sugar and all that!</p>

    <p>I must have gone to the same primary school as Martyn Day in Tufnell Park, I agree we were given a spoonful of Virol every week by a woman, thought she was the nurse. We used to queue up in the corridor by class, and it cost a penny. I loved it.  You were right, we all seemed healthier then. We were also given syrup of figs to keep us regular (normally after bath time on a Friday). Also Liquid Frutta, for coughs, tasted awful.</p>

    <p>My mother told me that she put Virol on my dummy and was convinced that the sticky sweet stuff was responsible for my baby teeth dropping out or needing to be extracted!! Beware&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember those times well.  My favourites in my childhood were Virol by the spoonful, wonderful.  Also Nestle&#39;s Milk (which was a sweet sticky fluid which came in a white tin) spread on a slice of bread.  Delicious!  I also remember as a child exploring an empty house which my father had bought and finding a large unlabelled tin (probably about 2kg size) of a brown powder, which we tasted.  My sister didn&#39;t like it, but I could not get enough of it.  It turned out to be instant coffee, which I had never seen before, and must explain why these days I am addicted to espresso.....</p>

    <p>I am confused.   Some say Virol was a meat product others say malt extract.  Who is correct?  Loved Virol.  I buy malt extract but has not the same depth of flavor.</p>

    <p>My late husband, born June 1936, had his photograph used in a Virol advertisement when he was a baby, as it was Virol that saved him from a sickly baby to a bouncing baby! I wonder if that advert still exists!</p>

    <p>I remember my mother dishing out Virol to myself and mt brother. Although I love both Bovril and Marmite we both hated Virol and so did some of our friends. We used to call it "Vile".</p>

    <p>I lived in Tufnell Park too from &#39;57 to &#39;67. Adored virol, couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Also rosehip syrup and haliborange vitamin pills. I can hear the squeak of the wrapper on the bottle of lucozade. If I had a temperature mum would carefully open the paper wrapper containing a Beecham&#39;s powder and dissolve it in water. You drank it down as fast as possible then got the lucozade to take away the taste. Survived measles, German measles, mumps, chicken pox, pneumonia - we were made of stern stuff then, and I reckon virol had a lot to do with it.</p>

    <p>I was born in 1951 and although i dont remember being given Virol my mum told me she used to dip my dummy in it. Although she took me to the dentist regularly it did not prevent my second teeth coming through decayed, I also recall having to have several baby teeth extracted. Im convinced the Virol accounted for this happening, through very assiduous care and good dentistry I have most of my natural teeth still, though many are filled, capped, crowned etc. Thank goodness for advances in dentistry but had I not been given Virol this way I feel my oral health wouldnt have suffered in the way it has.</p>

    <p>We, too, disliked Virol and called it Vile, although we didn&#39;t get it at school. Loved NH orange juice concentrate. The place we got it also housed the school dentist, which still used gas as an anesthetic. National Milk tins we kept jigsaws in. Loved the school milk. We could get extra ones in break time, as there was always a surplus. The only time I liked Lucozade was when I was ill and it was often the only thing I felt like. Survived chicken pox and measles, epidemics of which followed each other within a month, and mumps later, good to get over at an early age. We had stool samples collected from home during them. Lots of good plain food, including school dinners. All those milk puddings - Rice, semolina, sago and tapioca. We grew up to be taller than our parents. In my 6<sup>th</sup> form almost all the boys were six footers.</p>

    <p>I was very thin after measles as a child though looking at me now it&#226;&#128;&#153;s hard to believe. Was put on this by my mother and loathed it to the point I hid the jar inside a large vase. Was promised it would be my last jar if I told her where it was, I did and it was. Hated taste,smell and sound as the spoon came out with the brown goo Along with parishes food, fennings and Virol we had a good time and kids moan now</p>

    <p>I found this while trying to source Virol. It seems that this is no longer obtainable. The various malt extracts from H&amp;B are nowhere near as good. This is a product we were given in the &#226;&#128;&#152;50s and I miss, along with... Haliborange little round tablets Woodward&#226;&#128;&#153;s Gripe Water - better than gin Rosehip syrup</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember &#39;Virol&#39; in the early 1950&#39;s. Then it came in a swollen-topped glass jar with a tin lid which also had a tin circlip around it, I think, like those on paste jars of the same period. I remember that I liked it in those days. Several years ago I found an original &#39;pot/china&#39; jar of the same shape in an antiques&#39; shop. I still have it in my study ! I now see that H &amp; B stock the modern equivalent; it will be interesting to taste some as, of course, our taste changes over time. I remember how I disliked peanut butter as a child but love it now !</p>

    <p>I remember being given Virol as a child living in London during the 1960s, but definitely not at school.  I absolutely loved the stuff and remember being given spoonfuls of it.  Mum sometimes put Virol in hot milk to drink and she also used it as a sandwich spread.</p>

    <p>Sitting with my friend discussing memories of Virol. We were born 1943 and 1947. Both of us it turns out were brought up on daily Virol and we loved it. We had the /3 pt milk at school daily, National Health Orange and Cod Liver Oil which I can still drink from the bottle. We are now going to try some Malt Extract products, starting with a visit to Holland &amp; Barrett. Thanks for the memories</p>

    <p>Both I and my sister had Virol in the mid 1930&#39;s. We obtained it from a local centre in the High Road, Ilford. It was supplied in waxed cartons and we took it both from the spoon and also spread on bread and butter-delicious! From the same centre we also had Emulsion and taken on the spoon -again very nice. I was a fairly sickly child and am coming up to 90! my sister is a year older. I still have a few teeth and so does my sister - and she still manages on her own. Maybe we both have a lot to thank  Virol and Emulsion for and my Mother for keeping us well. A last comment is that Virol was not seen at school.</p>

    <p>I was supplemented with Virol in the 1940s.  Many decades later my mother told me it "saved me from being a wimp." !  (Not her exact words, but you get the message.)  It would be interesting to know what its ingredients were then.</p>
